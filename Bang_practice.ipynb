Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat? Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to. So, what do you guys do for fun around here? Okay, thankyou. This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this? Wow. So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys. This is really impressive. Holy smokes. Uh, do you guys mind if I start? So, sit next to me. What’s the difference? Do you want me to move? So, Klingon boggle? Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know. Participate in the what? Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. No, I’m from Omaha. I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny. It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School. I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.<br/> You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy? Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work. Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it? Thanks. You guys are really sweet.<br/> Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello! Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory. I’m sorry? Okay. Thanks. Hey, Leonard? Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour. It’s okay if you say no. It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met. So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University? Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English? Really, why? Wow, cool tiger. Uh, sounds interesting. Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it. Oh, my God, what happened? I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass. Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay? Sure. So? So? Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.) That sounds like fun.'"

One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti. Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank? Thank-you. We’ll be right back. What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro. Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment. I’m sure she’ll still love him. Well, what do you want to do? Okay. I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before. Okay. See you. No. Not really. I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right. Is that why they sent you to boarding school? New neighbour? Significant improvement over the old neighbour. Hi. Hi. We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall. Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms. Leonard, Sheldon. Hi. Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building. Oh, great. Great. Well, bye. Bye. Should we have invited her for lunch? We already watched the Season Two DVDs. I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome. Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle. Yes, and you’ve never met one of them. I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat. Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response. Hi. Again. Hi. Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about. Uh, yes. Great. Okay, well, make yourself at home. You’re very welcome. I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board. What? At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out. In what universe? Here we go. Just sit somewhere else. Sheldon, sit!&lt;br/&gt; Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over. Yes I now, but… Yes, I remember. I’m sorry. I said I’m sorry. Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you. I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess. Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job? Oh, okay. I love cheesecake. I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea. So it’s based on your life? Well, if that was a movie I would go see it. Well it sounds wonderful. I don’t know. Don’t. Should I say something? I feel like I should say something. No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse. Our shower works. No. No. It’s right down the hall. How so? That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode. The worst part was watching her carve that turkey. Excuse me? Well I’m not trying to have sex with her. What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female? I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour. That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly. It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.&lt;br/&gt; See what? This is not a good time. That’s great, you guys have to go. It’s just not a good time. No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour. Uh-huh. I’m not anticipating coitus. Can we please stop saying coitus? Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower. Save it for your blog, Howard. Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry. You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…. The hair products are Sheldon’s. A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you. Oh, I’ll probably say yes. Wow. Must we? She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon. Which is? That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come. Come on, you know how it is with break-ups. Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim. To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him. No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him. I’ll do the talking. Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV. We’re not going to give up just like that. Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang. Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building. Just grab the door. This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking. I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. Oh. We’re scientists. What? I’m sorry. Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this. And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex. Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone. Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend. We’re home. Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory. No, it was a valid hypothesis. Really? Great. Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974. It’s before he became a creepy computer voice Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town? Hang on, there really is a lady here? And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus? So she’s available for coitus? Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs. Bon douche. It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages. See-ka-tong-guay-jow. Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women. He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box? This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale. Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest. So you’ll think about it? Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke. Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me.   \n",
              "1  Agreed, what’s your point? Excuse me? One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti. Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank? Thank-you. We’ll be right back. What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro. Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment. I’m sure she’ll still love him. Well, what do you want to do? Okay. I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before. Okay. See you. No. Not really. I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right. Is that why they sent you to boarding school? New neighbour? Significant improvement over the old neighbour. Hi. Hi. We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall. Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms. Leonard, Sheldon. Hi. Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building. Oh, great. Great. Well, bye. Bye. Should we have invited her for lunch? We already watched the Season Two DVDs. I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome. Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle. Yes, and you’ve never met one of them. I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat. Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response. Hi. Again. Hi. Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about. Uh, yes. Great. Okay, well, make yourself at home. You’re very welcome. I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board. What? At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out. In what universe? Here we go. Just sit somewhere else. Sheldon, sit!<br/> Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over. Yes I now, but… Yes, I remember. I’m sorry. I said I’m sorry. Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you. I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess. Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job? Oh, okay. I love cheesecake. I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea. So it’s based on your life? Well, if that was a movie I would go see it. Well it sounds wonderful. I don’t know. Don’t. Should I say something? I feel like I should say something. No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse. Our shower works. No. No. It’s right down the hall. How so? That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode. The worst part was watching her carve that turkey. Excuse me? Well I’m not trying to have sex with her. What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female? I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour. That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly. It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.<br/> See what? This is not a good time. That’s great, you guys have to go. It’s just not a good time. No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour. Uh-huh. I’m not anticipating coitus. Can we please stop saying coitus? Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower. Save it for your blog, Howard. Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry. You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…. The hair products are Sheldon’s. A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you. Oh, I’ll probably say yes. Wow. Must we? She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon. Which is? That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come. Come on, you know how it is with break-ups. Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim. To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him. No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him. I’ll do the talking. Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV. We’re not going to give up just like that. Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang. Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building. Just grab the door. This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking. I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. Oh. We’re scientists. What? I’m sorry. Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this. And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex. Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone. Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend. We’re home. Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory. No, it was a valid hypothesis. Really? Great. Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti. Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank? Thank-you. We’ll be right back. What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro. Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment. I’m sure she’ll still love him. Well, what do you want to do? Okay. I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before. Okay. See you. No. Not really. I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right. Is that why they sent you to boarding school? New neighbour? Significant improvement over the old neighbour. Hi. Hi. We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall. Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms. Leonard, Sheldon. Hi. Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building. Oh, great. Great. Well, bye. Bye. Should we have invited her for lunch? We already watched the Season Two DVDs. I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome. Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle. Yes, and you’ve never met one of them. I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat. Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response. Hi. Again. Hi. Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about. Uh, yes. Great. Okay, well, make yourself at home. You’re very welcome. I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board. What? At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out. In what universe? Here we go. Just sit somewhere else. Sheldon, sit!&lt;br/&gt; Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over. Yes I now, but… Yes, I remember. I’m sorry. I said I’m sorry. Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you. I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess. Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job? Oh, okay. I love cheesecake. I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea. So it’s based on your life? Well, if that was a movie I would go see it. Well it sounds wonderful. I don’t know. Don’t. Should I say something? I feel like I should say something. No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse. Our shower works. No. No. It’s right down the hall. How so? That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode. The worst part was watching her carve that turkey. Excuse me? Well I’m not trying to have sex with her. What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female? I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour. That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly. It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.&lt;br/&gt; See what? This is not a good time. That’s great, you guys have to go. It’s just not a good time. No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour. Uh-huh. I’m not anticipating coitus. Can we please stop saying coitus? Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower. Save it for your blog, Howard. Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry. You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…. The hair products are Sheldon’s. A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you. Oh, I’ll probably say yes. Wow. Must we? She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon. Which is? That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come. Come on, you know how it is with break-ups. Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim. To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him. No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him. I’ll do the talking. Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV. We’re not going to give up just like that. Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang. Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building. Just grab the door. This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking. I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. Oh. We’re scientists. What? I’m sorry. Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this. And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex. Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone. Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend. We’re home. Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory. No, it was a valid hypothesis. Really? Great. Our babies will be smart and beautiful.

I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass. Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay? Sure. So? So? Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.) That sounds like fun.</td>\n",

If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits. There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt. I think this is the place. Leonard, I don’t think I can do this. No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers. I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve. I wouldn’t. I want to leave. What’s the protocol for leaving? Let’s try just walking out. Bye-bye Are you still mad about the sperm bank? You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs? If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip. No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle. No, that was the result of my work with lasers. Evidently. Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is. Hi. Hi. Hi. Great. Bye. No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica. Not with commentary. We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over. I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. That’s the beauty of it. Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline. To what end? Hi. Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements. Well, today we tried masturbating for money. Actually that’s my work. Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation. Yeah. If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure. Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?” I didn’t invent them, they’re there. In all of them, that is the point. Um, Penny, that’s where I sit. No, I sit there. What’s the difference? In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. Well. Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.) Aaah! That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning. I resent you saying we don’t have company. That is an antisocial implication. Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality. That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn. You’re lactose intolerant. What’s happening. It took you four years to get through High School? You? No, you’ll only make it worse. Yes. Yes. No? No. Well this is an interesting development. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment. Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? Leonard has a lady over. Technically that would be coitus interruptus. I really think we should examine the chain of causality here. Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events? Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause. You think with your penis. Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV. No I don’t. And neither do you. You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea. So we get to have a scene with him? Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV. Hello. Okay, thanks for your time. Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done. My apologies. What’s your plan. It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work. What do you think their combined IQ is? Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle. From the intercom. Tell him about our IQ. Leonard. My mom bought me those pants. You’re going to have to call her. It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last. Well you got me out of my pants. Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone. And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize. That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you? Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you? Not to mention imaginary. We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch. They’re both curry based cuisines. They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl. I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy.</td>\n",

It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974. It’s before he became a creepy computer voice Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town? Hang on, there really is a lady here? And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus? So she’s available for coitus? Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs. Bon douche. It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages. See-ka-tong-guay-jow. Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women. He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box? This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale. Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest. So you’ll think about it? Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke. Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me.   \n",
              "1                                                                                                                                                                                          Agreed, what’s your point? Excuse me? One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti. Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank? Thank-you. We’ll be right back. What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro. Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment. I’m sure she’ll still love him. Well, what do you want to do? Okay. I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before. Okay. See you. No. Not really. I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right. Is that why they sent you to boarding school? New neighbour? Significant improvement over the old neighbour. Hi. Hi. We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall. Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms. Leonard, Sheldon. Hi. Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building. Oh, great. Great. Well, bye. Bye. Should we have invited her for lunch? We already watched the Season Two DVDs. I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome. Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle. Yes, and you’ve never met one of them. I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat. Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response. Hi. Again. Hi. Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about. Uh, yes. Great. Okay, well, make yourself at home. You’re very welcome. I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board. What? At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out. In what universe? Here we go. Just sit somewhere else. Sheldon, sit!<br/> Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over. Yes I now, but… Yes, I remember. I’m sorry. I said I’m sorry. Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you. I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess. Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job? Oh, okay. I love cheesecake. I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea. So it’s based on your life? Well, if that was a movie I would go see it. Well it sounds wonderful. I don’t know. Don’t. Should I say something? I feel like I should say something. No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse. Our shower works. No. No. It’s right down the hall. How so? That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode. The worst part was watching her carve that turkey. Excuse me? Well I’m not trying to have sex with her. What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female? I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour. That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly. It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.<br/> See what? This is not a good time. That’s great, you guys have to go. It’s just not a good time. No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour. Uh-huh. I’m not anticipating coitus. Can we please stop saying coitus? Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower. Save it for your blog, Howard. Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry. You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…. The hair products are Sheldon’s. A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you. Oh, I’ll probably say yes. Wow. Must we? She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon. Which is? That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come. Come on, you know how it is with break-ups. Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim. To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him. No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him. I’ll do the talking. Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV. We’re not going to give up just like that. Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang. Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building. Just grab the door. This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking. I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon. Oh. We’re scientists. What? I’m sorry. Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this. And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex. Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone. Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend. We’re home. Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory. No, it was a valid hypothesis. Really? Great. Our babies will be smart and beautiful. Is Thai food okay with you Penny?   \n",

Hi? Oh, that’s nice. Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny. Hi. Hi. Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime. Great. Bye. Hi. Hi. Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat? Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to. So, what do you guys do for fun around here? Okay, thankyou. This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this? Wow. So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys. This is really impressive. Holy smokes. Uh, do you guys mind if I start? So, sit next to me. What’s the difference? Do you want me to move? So, Klingon boggle? Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know. Participate in the what? Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. No, I’m from Omaha. I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny. It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School. I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.<br/> You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy? Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work. Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it? Thanks. You guys are really sweet.<br/> Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello! Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory. I’m sorry? Okay. Thanks. Hey, Leonard? Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour. It’s okay if you say no. It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met. So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University? Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English? Really, why? Wow, cool tiger. Uh, sounds interesting. Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it. Oh, my God, what happened? I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass. Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay? Sure. So? So? Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.) That sounds like fun.   \n",

              "5  So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits. There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt. I think this is the place. Leonard, I don’t think I can do this. No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers. I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve. I wouldn’t. I want to leave. What’s the protocol for leaving? Let’s try just walking out. Bye-bye Are you still mad about the sperm bank? You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs? If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip. No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle. No, that was the result of my work with lasers. Evidently. Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is. Hi. Hi. Hi. Great. Bye. No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica. Not with commentary. We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over. I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. That’s the beauty of it. Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline. To what end? Hi. Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements. Well, today we tried masturbating for money. Actually that’s my work. Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation. Yeah. If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure. Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?” I didn’t invent them, they’re there. In all of them, that is the point. Um, Penny, that’s where I sit. No, I sit there. What’s the difference? In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. Well. Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.) Aaah! That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning. I resent you saying we don’t have company. That is an antisocial implication. Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality. That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn. You’re lactose intolerant. What’s happening. It took you four years to get through High School? You? No, you’ll only make it worse. Yes. Yes. No? No. Well this is an interesting development. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment. Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? Leonard has a lady over. Technically that would be coitus interruptus. I really think we should examine the chain of causality here. Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events? Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause. You think with your penis. Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV. No I don’t. And neither do you. You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea. So we get to have a scene with him? Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV. Hello. Okay, thanks for your time. Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done. My apologies. What’s your plan. It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work. What do you think their combined IQ is? Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle. From the intercom. Tell him about our IQ. Leonard. My mom bought me those pants. You’re going to have to call her. It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last. Well you got me out of my pants. Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone. And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize. That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you? Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you? Not to mention imaginary. We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch. They’re both curry based cuisines. They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl. I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy.   \n",

So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys. This is really impressive. Holy smokes. Uh, do you guys mind if I start? So, sit next to me. What’s the difference? Do you want me to move? So, Klingon boggle? Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know. Participate in the what? Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. No, I’m from Omaha. I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny. It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School. I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.<br/> You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy? Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work. Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it? Thanks. You guys are really sweet.<br/> Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello! Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory. I’m sorry? Okay. Thanks. Hey, Leonard? Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour. It’s okay if you say no. It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met. So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University? Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English? Really, why? Wow, cool tiger. Uh, sounds interesting. Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it. Oh, my God, what happened? I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass. Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific.
